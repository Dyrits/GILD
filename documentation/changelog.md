## CHG-0001 · 2026-11-04 · Thread tree and thread messaging specified

Type: Documentation
Event: Agreement
Scope: Thread tree and thread messaging

Summary: Agreed the observable behavior and acceptance of thread-tree and thread-messaging:
- opening threads, with copied and editable defaults;
- the starting context, including the opener's messages since the last journal entry;
- subagents as threads;
- the seven thread states;
- results that reach the parent whenever they come;
- stopping without cascade, and deleting with confirmation;
- user-only depth limit, running-thread cap, and budget guard;
- tree-bound messaging, with delivery into the current turn where possible;
- steer or queue for user messages;
- interruptions and the chatter guard.
Reason: Every other capability builds on threads and their messages.
References: documentation/capabilities/thread-tree/specifications.md, documentation/capabilities/thread-messaging/specifications.md
Validation: Authorized by the user in the specification interview, rounds 1 and 2, on 2026-11-04.
Evidence: The user's answers in that interview.

## CHG-0002 · 2026-11-04 · Off-topic requests become missions or asides

Type: Documentation
Event: Agreement
Scope: Thread tree

Summary: When a user's message clearly shares nothing with the mission's journal summary, the thread suggests a new mission instead of answering. Declining opens an aside beneath the thread, kept out of the mission journal. Both start fresh with only the off-topic part of the message, and the original thread keeps a link to where it went. A setting can skip the suggestion. The thread tool for this is `suggest_mission`.
Reason: Missions stay focused, and their journals free of unrelated work.

Validation: Authorized by the user on 2026-11-04.
Evidence: The user's answers to the off-topic request questions.

## CHG-0003 · 2026-11-04 · Asides stay aware of their mission

Type: Documentation
Event: Agreement
Scope: Thread tree

Summary: Changes how an aside starts and what it may do, replacing that part of CHG-0002. It starts with:
- the off-topic part of the message;
- the mission journal's summary;
- a note that the message was put aside;
- the rule to inform its parent with a thread message whenever the conversation comes back to the mission.
It still does not update the journal itself. A new mission opened from an off-topic request still starts fresh.
Reason: The user can drift back to the mission inside an aside, and the mission must hear about it.
References: documentation/capabilities/thread-tree/specifications.md#off-topic-requests
Validation: Authorized by the user on 2026-11-04.
Evidence: The user's message correcting the aside's starting context.

## CHG-0004 · 2026-11-04 · Off-topic requests can continue another mission

Type: Documentation
Event: Agreement
Scope: Thread tree

Summary: Before suggesting a new mission for an off-topic request, the thread looks for missions that fit it, using `find_missions`. The search covers titles and journal summaries only, and includes every mission that is not deleted. The suggestion lists up to 3 matching missions first, as Continue in choices. Continue in sends the off-topic part to that mission's top thread as the user's message, waking it if it is Done or Idle. The setting that skips the suggestion applies only when no mission matches.
Reason: Requests that belong to an existing mission should continue it rather than start a duplicate.
References: documentation/capabilities/thread-tree/specifications.md#off-topic-requests
Validation: Authorized by the user on 2026-11-04.
Evidence: The user's answers to the mission discovery questions.
